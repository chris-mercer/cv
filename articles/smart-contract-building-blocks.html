<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Introduction </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>The contract, a set of promises agreed to in a &quot;meeting of the
minds&quot;, is the traditional way to formalize a relationship. While
contracts are primarily used in business relationships (the focus of this
article), they can also involve personal relationships such as marraiges.
Contracts are also important in politics, not only because of &quot;social
contract&quot; theories but also because contract enforcement has traditionally
been considered a basic function of capitalist governments. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Whether enforced by a government, or otherwise, the contract is the
basic building block of a free market economy. Over many centuries of cultural
evolution has emerged both the concept of contract and principles related
to it, encoded into common law. <A HREF="kolmogorov.html">Algorithmic
information theory </A>suggests that such evolved structures are often
prohibitively costly to recompute. If we started from scratch, using reason
and experience, it could take many centuries to redevelop sophisticated
ideas like property rights that make the modern free market work [Hayek].
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>The success of the common law of contracts, combined with the high cost
of replacing it, makes it worthwhile to both preserve and to make use of
these principles where appropriate. Yet, the digital revolution is radically
changing the kinds of relationships we can have. What parts of our hard-won
legal tradition will still be valuable in the cyberspace era? What is the
best way to apply these common law principles to the design of our on-line
relationships? </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Computers make possible the running of algorithms heretofore prohibitively
costly, and networks the quicker transmission of larger and more sophsiticated
messages. Furthermore, computer scientists and cryptographers have recently
discovered many new and quite interesting algorithms. Combining these messages
and algorithms makes possible a wide variety of new protocols. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>New institutions, and new ways to formalize the relationships that make
up these institutions, are now made possible by the digital revolution.
I call these new contracts &quot;smart&quot;, because they are far more
functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial
intelligence is implied. A smart contract is a set of promises, specified
in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on
these promises. </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Contracts Embedded in the World </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>The basic idea of smart contracts is that many kinds of contractual
clauses (such as liens, bonding, delineation of property rights, etc.)
can be embedded in the hardware and software we deal with, in such a way
as to make breach of contract expensive (if desired, sometimes prohibitively
so) for the breacher. A canonical real-life example, which we might consider
to be the primitive ancestor of smart contracts, is the humble vending
machine. Within a limited amount of potential loss (the amount in the till
should be less than the cost of breaching the mechanism), the machine takes
in coins, and via a simple mechanism, which makes a beginner's level problem
in design with finite automata, dispense change and product fairly. Smart
contracts go beyond the vending machine in proposing to embed contracts
in all sorts of property that is valuable and controlled by digital means.
Smart contracts reference that property in a dynamic, proactively enforced
form, and provide much better observation and verification where proactive
measures must fall short. And where the vending machine, like electronic
mail, implements an asynchronous protocol between the vending company and
the customer, some smart contracts entail multiple synchronous steps between
two or more parties. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Other forerunners of smart contracts include POS (Point of Sale) terminals
and cards, EDI (Electronic Data Interchange, used for ordering and other
transactionsbetween large corporations), and the SWIFT, ACH, and FedWire
networks for transferring and clearing payments between banks. These implement
commercial security models, but too often with little heed paid to the
contractual needs and obligations of the parties. </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Attacks against Smart Contracts </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A broad statement of the key idea of smart contracts, then, is to say
that contracts should be <I>embedded in the world</I>. The mechanisms of
the world should be structured in such a way as to make the contracts </P>

<P>(a) robust against naive vandalism, and </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>(b) robust against sophisticated, incentive compatible (rational) breach
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A vandal can be a strategy or sub-strategy of a game whose utility is
at least partially a function of one's own negative utility; or it can
be a mistake by a contracting party to the same effect. &quot;Naive&quot;
simply refers to both lack of forethought as to the consequences of a breach,
as well as the relatively low amount of resources expended to enable that
breach. Naive vandalism is common enough that it must be taken into consideration.
A third category, (c) sophisticated vandalism (where the vandals can and
are willing to sacrifice substantial resources), for example a military
attack by third parties, is of a special and difficult kind that doesn't
often arise in typical contracting, so that we can place it in a separate
category and ignore it here. The distinction between naive and sophisticated
strategies has been computationally formalized in <A HREF="kolmogorov.html">algorithmic
information theory </A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Some Basic Princiapls of Contract Design </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>The threat of physical force is an obvious way to embed a contract in
the world -- have a judicial system decide what physical steps are to be
taken out by an enforcement agency (including arrest, confiscation of property,
etc.) in response to a breach of contract. It is what I call a <I>reactive</I>
form of security. The need to invoke reactive security can be minimized,
but not eliminated, by making contractual arrangements <I>verifiable</I>,
for example by recording a breach on a video camera, or putting a signature
on a contract, in order to prove breach claims in court. <I>Observation</I>
of a contract in progress, in order to detect the first sign of breach
and minimize losses, also is a reactive form of security. A <I>proactive</I>
form of security is a physical mechanism that makes breach expensive, such
as a combination lock that makes access to a room containing trade secrets
expensive without explicit authorization. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>From common law, economic theory, and contractual conditions often found
in practice, we can distill four basic objectives of contract design. The
first of these is <I>observability</I>, the ability of the principals to
observe each others' performance of the contract, or to prove their performance
to other principals. The field of accounting is, roughly speaking, primarily
concerned with making contracts an organization is involved in more observable.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A second objective <I>verifiability</I>, the ability of a principal
to prove to an arbitrator that a contract has been performed or breached,
or the ability of the arbitrator to find this out by other means. The disciplines
of auditing and investigation roughly correspond with verification of contract
performance. Observability and verifiability can also include the ability
to differentiate between intentional violations of the contract and good
faith errors. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A third objective of contract design is <I>privity</I>, the principle
that knowledge and control over the contents and performance of a contract
should be distributed among parties only as much as is necessary for the
performance of that contract. This is a generalization of the common law
principle of contract privity, which states that third parties, other than
the designated arbitrators and intermediaries, should have no say in the
enforcement of a contract. Generalized privity goes beyond this to formalize
the common claim, &quot;it's none of your business&quot;. Attacks against
privity are epitomized by third parties Eve the eavesdropper, a passive
observer of contents or performance, and malicious Mallet, who actively
interferes with performance or steals service. Under this model privacy
and confidentiality, or protecting the value of information about a contract,
its parties, and its performance from Eve, is subsumed under privity, as
are property rights. The field of security (especially, for smart contracts,
computer and network security), roughly corresponds to the goal of privity.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A fourth objective is <I>enforceability</I>, and at the same time minimizing
the need for enforcement. Improved verifiability often also helps meet
this fourth objective. Reputation, built-in incentives, &quot;self-enforcing&quot;
protocols, and verifiability can all play a strong part in meeting the
fourth objective. Computer and network security also can contribute greatly
to making smart contracts self-enforcing. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Smart contracts often involve trusted third parties, exemplified by
an intermediary, who is involved in the performance, and an arbitrator,
who is invoked to resolve disputes arising out of performance (or lack
thereof). Privity implies that we want to minimize vulnerability to third
parties. Verifiability and observabiliy often require that we invoke them.
A mediator must be trusted with some of the contents and/or performance
of the contract. An arbitrator must be trusted with some of the contents,
and some of the history of performance, and to resolve disputes and invoke
penalties fairly. In smart contract design we want to get the most out
of intermediaries and arbitrators, while minimizing exposure to them. One
common outcome is that confidentiality is violated only in case of dispute.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>In the future the size distribution of multinational companies will
approach that of local business, giving rise to <A HREF="multi.small.html">multinational
small business </A>. Legal barriers are the most severe cost of doing business
across many jurisdictions. Smart contracts can cut through this Gordian
knot of jurisdictions. Where smart contracts can increase privity, they
can decrease vulnerability to capricious jurisdictions. Where smart contracts
can increase observability or verifiability, they can decrease dependence
on these obscure local legal codes and enforcement traditions. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>The consequences of smart contract design on contract law and economics,
and on strategic contract drafting, (and vice versa), have been little
explored. As well, I suspect the possibilities for greatly reducing the
transaction costs of executing some kinds of contracts, and the opportunities
for creating new kinds of businesses and social institutions based on smart
contracts, are vast but little explored. The &quot;cypherpunks&quot; have
explored the political impact of some of the new protocol building blocks.
The field of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), in which elements of traditional
business transactions (invoices, receipts, etc.) are exchanged electronically,
sometimes including encryption and digital signature capabilities, can
be viewed as a primitive forerunner to smart contracts. Indeed those business
forms can provide good starting points and channel markers for smart contract
designers. </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Observability &amp; Hidden Actions </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>One important task of smart contracts, that has been largely overlooked
by traditional EDI, is critical to &quot;the meeting of the minds&quot;
that is at the heart of a contract: communicating the semantics of the
protocols to the parties involved. There is ample opportunity in smart
contracts for &quot;smart fine print&quot;: actions taken by the software
hidden from a party to the transaction. For example, grocery store POS
machines don't tell customers whether or not their names are being linked
to their purchases in a database. The clerks don't even know, and they've
processed thousands of such transactions under their noses. Thus, via hidden
action of the software, the customer is giving away information they might
consider valuable or confidential, but the contract has been drafted, and
transaction has been designed, in such a way as to hide those important
parts of that transaction from the customer. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>To properly communicate transaction semantics, we need good visual metaphors
for the elements of the contract. These would hide the details of the protocol
without surrendering control over the knowledge and execution of contract
terms. A primitive but good example is provided by the SecureMosiac software
from CommerceNet. Encryption is shown by putting the document in an envelope,
and a digital signature by affixing a seal onto the document or envelope.
On the other hand, Mosaic servers log connections, and sometimes even transactions,
without warning users -- classic hidden actions. </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Cryptographic Building Blocks </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Protocols based on mathematics, called <I>cryptographic protocols</I>,
tre the basic building blocks that implement the improved tradeoffs between
observability, verifiability, privity, and enforceability in smart contracts.
Contrary to the common wisdom, obscurity is often critical to security.
Cryptographic protocols are built around foci of obscurity called <I>keys</I>.
A key's immense unknown randomness allows the rest of the system to be
simple and public. The obscurity of a large random number, so vast that
a lucky guess is unlikely in in, if desired, the lifetime of the universe,
is the foundation upon which cryptographic protocols, and in turn smart
contracts, are built. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A wide variety of new cryptographic protocols have emerged in recent
years. The most tradtional kind of cryptography is <I>secret key</I> cryptography,
in which Alice and Bob (our exemplar parties to a smart contract) use a
single shared, prearranged key to encrypt messages between them. A fundamental
problem we will see throughout these protocols is the need to keep keys
secret, and <I>pubilic key</I> cryptography helps solve this. In this technique,
Alice generates two keys, called the private and public keys. She keeps
the private key secret and well protected, and publishes the public key.
When Bob wishes to send a message to Alice, he encrypts a message with
her public key, sends the encrypted message, and she decrypts the message
with her private key. The private key provides a &quot;trapdoor&quot; that
allows Alice to compute an easy inverse of the encryption function that
used the public key. The public key provides no clue as to what the private
key is, even though they are mathematically related. The <A HREF="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/rsa.html">RSA</A>
algorithm is the most widely used method of public key cryptography. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Public key cryptography also makes possible a wide variety of <I>digital
signatures</I>. These proves that a piece of data (hereafter referred to
as just an &quot;object&quot;) was in active contact with the private key
corresponding to the signature: the object was actively &quot;signed&quot;
with that key. The digital signature probably should have been called a
&quot;digital stamp&quot; or &quot;digital seal&quot; since its function
resembles more those methods than an autograph. In particular, it is not
biometric like an autograph, although incorporation of a typed-in password
as part of the private key used to sign can sometimes subsitute for an
autograph. In many Asian countries, a hand-carved wooden block, called
a &quot;chop&quot;, is often used instead of autographs. Every chop is
unique, and because of the unique carving and wood grain cannot be copied.
A digital signature is similar to the chop, since every newly generated
key is unique, but it is trivial to copy the key if obtained from the holder.
A digital signature relies on the assumption that the holder will keep
the private key secret. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A <I>blind signature</I> is a digital signature and secret-key encryption
protocol that together have the mathematical property of commutativity,
so that they can be stripped in reverse of the order they were applied.
The effect is that Bob &quot;signs&quot; an object, for which he can verify
its general form, but cannot see its specific content. Typically the key
of the signature defines the meaning of the signed object, rather than
the contents of the object signed, so that Bob doesn't sign a blank check.
Blind signatures used in digital bearer instruments, where Bob is the clearing
agent, and in <A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/publish/bigbro.html">Chaumian
credentials</A> , where Bob is the credential issuer. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P><I>Secret sharing</I> is a method of splitting a key (and thus control
over any object encrypted with that key) into N parts, of which only M
are needed to recreate the key, but less than M of the parts provide no
information about the key. Secret sharing is a potent tool for distributing
control over objects between principals. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.niksula.cs.hut.fi/~haa/nonpub/zeroknowledge.html">zero-knowledge
interactive proof</A> is an alternative to public key methods for challenge-response
identification. Otherwise normally functioning parties who have an incentive
to respond properly to the challenge, but fail to do so, do not possess
the key), without revealing any information about that privatge key to
the challenger or any eavesdroppers. ZKIPs are currently used for authentication,
and in smart weapons for Identification Friend or Foe (IFF). </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Information about who is talking to whom, such as can be found on telephone
bills, can be quite valuable even without records of the actual content.
Confidential messsaging is necessary for the some of the privity features
of <A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/publish/bigbro.html">Chaumian credentials</A>
and bearer securities to be strongly implemented on an actual network.
To provide this traffic confidentiality, a <I>digital mix</I> can allow
parties to communicate across a network without revealing their partners
to network providers or the outside world. In a mix, traffic analysis by
Eve is prevented by the Russian-doll encryption of the message by the sender
with the public keys of each mix operator in the chain, and the mixing
of messages by each operator, so that panoptic wiretapper Eve loses track
of the messages. For the sender/recipient pair to remain confidential,
only 1 out of N of the operators needs to be trusted with their local traffic
information, although Eve can sometimes gather statistics over large numbers
of messages between the same partners to eventually guess who is talking
to whom. The communicating parties can also be mutually anonymous, and
with normal encryption need trust no other parties with the content of
messages. The &quot;Mixmaster&quot; software on the Internet implements
most of the features of a digital mix[Mixmaster]. </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Protection of Keys </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>So far, we've assumed parties like Alice and Bob are monolithic. But
in the world of smart contracts, they will use computer-based software
agents and smart cards to do their electronic bidding. Keys are not necessarily
tied to identities, and the task of doing such binding turns out to be
more difficult than at first glance. Once keys are bound, they need to
be well protected, but wide area network connections are notoriously to
hacking. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>If we assume that the attacker has the ability to intercept and redirect
any messages in the network protocol, as is the case on wide area netowrks
such as the Internet. then we must also assume, for practical all commercial
operating systems, that they would also be able to invade client if not
merchant computers and find any keys lying on the disk. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>There's no completely satisfactory solution to end point operations
security from network-based attacks, but here's a strategy for practically
defanging this problem for public-key based systems: </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>All public key operation are are done inside an unreadable hardware
board on a machine with a very narrow serial-line connection (ie, it carries
only a simple single-use protocol with well-verified security) to a dedicated
firewall. Such a board is available, for example, from Kryptor, and I believe
Viacrypt may also have a PGP-compatable board. This is economical for central
sites, but may be less practical for normal users. Besides better security,
it has the added advantage that hardware speeds up the public key computations.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>If Mallet's capability is to physically sieze the machine, a weaker
form of key protection will suffice. The trick is to hold the keys in volatile
memory. This makes the PC proof from physical attacks -- all that needed
to destroy the keys is to turn off the PC. If the key backups can be hidden
in a different, secure physical location, this allows the user of this
PC to encrypt large amounts of data both on the PC itself and on public
computer networks, without fear that physical attack against the PC will
compromise that data. The data is still vulnerable to a &quot;rubber hose
attack&quot; where the owner is coerced into revealing the hidden keys.
Protection against rubber hose attacks might require some form of Shamir
secret sharing which splits the keys between diverse phgsical sites. </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>The Man In the Middle &amp; PGP's Web of Trust </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>How does Alice know she has Bob's key? Who, indeed, can be the parties
to a smart contract? Can they be defined just by their keys? Do we need
biometrics (such as autographs, typed-in passwords, retina scans, etc.)?
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>The public key cryptography software package &quot;Pretty Good Privacy&quot;
(PGP) uses a model called &quot;the web of trust&quot;. Alice chooses <I>introducers</I>
whom she trusts to properly identify the map between other people and their
public keys. PGP takes it from there, automatically validating any other
keys that have been signed by Alice's designated introducers. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>There are two entirely separate criteria PGP uses to judge a public
key's usefulness: </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>1) Does the key actually belong to whom it appears to belong? In other
words, has it been certified with a trusted signature? </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>2) Does it belong to an introducers, someone you can trust to certify

<P>Having been told by Alice the answer to the second question, PGP can
calculates the answer to the first question for the public keys Alice has
collected. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Keys that have been certified by a trusted introducer are deemed valid
by PGP. The keys belonging to trusted introducers must themselves be certified
either by you or by other trusted introducers. This &quot;transitivity&quot;
introduces an implicit third criterion </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>3) Does the key belong to someone you can trust to introduce other introducers?
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>PGP confuses this with criterion (2). It is not clear that any single
person has enough judgement to properly undertake task (3), nor has a reasonable
institution been proposed that will do so. This is one of the unsolved
problems in smart contracts. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>PGP also can be given trust ratings and programmed to compute a weighted
score of validity-- for example, two marginally trusted signatures might
be considered as credible as one fully trusted signature. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Any keys in Alice's secret key ring are &quot;axiomatically&quot; valid
to Alice's PGP program, needing no introducer's signature. PGP also assumes
that Alice ultimately trusts herself to certify other keys. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>It is believed that PGP causes the emergence of a decentralized fault-tolerant
web of confidence for all public keys, but a chain of introduced introducers
grows weak very quickly, due to lack of transitivity. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>PGP's grass-roots approach contrasts sharply with tradtional public
key management schemes, such as X.509 and the related Privacy Enhanced
Mail (PEM). These standard schemes subsistute a heirarchical system of
introducers called certification authorities (CAs). </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Notaries Public </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Two different acts are often called &quot;notarization&quot;. The first
is simply where one swears to the truth of some affidavit before a notary
or some other officer entitled to take oaths. This does not require the
notary to know who the affiant is. The second act is when someone &quot;acknowledges&quot;
before a notary that he has executed a document as ``his own act and deed.''
This second act requires the notary to know the person making the acknowledgment.
Thus, for example, the form of an acknowledgment can go something like
this: </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>On this ____ day of ___, 19__, personally appeared before me ____, known
to me and known to me to be the person who signed the foregoing instrument,
and acknowledged that he executed the same as his own act and deed. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>In the first type of act of notarization, the notary merely certifies
that the affiant swore the statement was true. In the second type the notary
actually vouches that the person making the acknowledgment was who he claims
to be. </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Problems with Certification </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>These roles of a notary public are substantially different from the
alleged role of heirarchies of &quot;certification authorities&quot; (CAs)
in PEM/X.509, and the &quot;web of trust&quot; in PGP, to &quot;prove identity&quot;.
In fact the certificates generated by these systems do no such thing. Rather
a certficate <I>proves that a claim was made</I> by a CA at some time in
the past. The (implicit) claim is that a particular key belonged to a particular
person at that time. That key is not biometric like an autograph, and can
thus be transferred at any time. Furthermore, false claims can be made
by a CA about what keys an end-user has held, and the end-user can be stuck
with no evidence of CA fraud; nor does the CA have any way of proving that
their claim is correct if an end-user challenges it. It is extremely difficult,
on the other hand, for notary publics to forge autographs and expect to
get away with it often enough to maintain their professional reputations.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Both the PGP web of trust and X.509 models suffer from more flaws. A
single rooted heirarchy assumes a mythological beast called a universally
trusted entity. Heirarchies in general create rigid structures that don't
fit the way knowledge about keys and keyholders, and incentives to accurately
reflect that knowledge, are distributed among people in the real world.
In turn, hile PGP distinguishes between &quot;Alice holds a key&quot; and
&quot;Alice can be trusted to certify a key&quot;, it does not follow that
the second claim that Alice can be trusted to validate another issuer.
There is little transitivity: seeing Alice's key certified by Bob, whom
I know and trust, tells me little about whether Alice's certification of
Charlie's key is correct. Seeing Alice certified by Bob as an introducer
tells me little about wether Alice can be trusted to certify other introducers.
It does tell me that I know to blame Alice if her claim turns out to be
wrong; although it's far from clear that Alice has any legal liability.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>There is an even more severe flaw when public key is used for digital
signatures. Because the claim was only made in the past, both PGP and X.509
allow the end user to plausible deny that they &quot;signed&quot; a document;
and conversely if one's key is surreptitiously stolen, or for other reasons
no revocation action is taken, there is no way to prove that one did not
&quot;sign&quot; the documenent digitally &quot;signed&quot; with the stolen
key. Finally, there is no widely accepted legal agreement on what is specifically
being claimed when one &quot;certifies&quot; a key, nor is there any built-in
or widely used mechanism for describing the actual claim one is making.
Real world CAs have a nasty habit of disclaiming liability for their mistakes,
or for the misunderstandings that will arise out of the often vague and
sloppy, sometimes implicit claims they make. Finally, there are a wide
variety of other claims one might make about a key, such as &quot;this
key belongs to an office&quot;, &quot;this key belongs to a server&quot;,
&quot;this keyholder has a good credit rating&quot;, &quot;use this key
to decrypt your new copy of Microsquish Expel&quot;, &quot;this key is
good for 100 MB of downloads from our web server&quot;, etc. which are
facilitated by neither X.509 nor the PGP web of trust. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>We know too little about the best uses of public-key cryptography to
establish such fixed methods with such narrow semantics. This author has
suggested a mechanism which modifies the PGP web of trust to create arbitrary
certificate with a form roughly as follows: </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Key about which a claim is being made type of claim, in some standard
one-line format (like MIME types) Plain text description of claim Timestamp
digitally &quot;signed&quot;, Alice's key </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>In other words, all claims about keys should be <I>explicit</I>, readily
known from reading the certificate itself, and no kind of claim should
be arbitrarily excluded by the mechanism. The legal force of the claim
can be based on the text itself, rather than overstated, obscure, and often
implicit interpretations about what &quot;certifying&quot; is supposed
to mean. Standard kinds of claims will emerge, including perhaps more transitive
&quot;good judge of judgement&quot; certificates for which chain-following
software can be written, and non-transitive &quot;is-a-person&quot; credentials
directly &quot;bound&quot; to traditional notarized identification by a
physical notarization protocol that includes both autographs and digital
&quot;signatures&quot;. More likely, new and more useful kinds of certificates
will evolve. These standards should be allowed to emerge out of the wide
varieties of possible end uses, much like case law has matured over time,
rather than being dictated by our current very inexperienced understanding.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Meanwhile, there is a more practical defense aggainst the man in the
middle attack: advertise, early and often. Users of an insecure network
can communicate the integrity of a key reasonably well by tying it to a
persistent pattern of behavior: for example posts in a persistent style
from a persistent e-mail address, persistence of a key unchallenged on
a key server, etc. This is the most practical and widely used way by which
PGP users gain confidence in public keys, and it does not require certification
authorities or introducers. Those who advertise their keys widely, and
those who are well known, are more likely to have keys bound to their person.
</P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Virtual Personae </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>&quot;Identity&quot; is hardly the only thing we might want map to a
key. After all, physical keys we use for our house, car, etc. are not necessarily
tied to our identity -- we can loan them to trusted friends and relatives,
make copies of them, etc. Indeed, in cyberspace we might create &quot;virtual
personae&quot; to reflect such multi-person relationships, or in contrast
to reflect different parts of our personality that we do not want others
to link. Here is a possible classification scheme for virtual personae,
pedagogically presented: </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A <I>nym</I> is an identifier that links only a small amount of related
information about a person, usually that information deemed by the nym
holder to be relevant to a particular organization or community. Examples
of nyms include electronic bulletin board nicknames, pen names, aliases,
and brand names. A nym may gain reputation within its community. For example,
a conglomerate may sell a wide variety of brand names, each reputable in
its own market niche. With <A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/publish/bigbro.html">Chaumian
credentials</A> , a nym can take advantage of the positive credentials
of the holder's other nyms, as provably linked by the is-a-person credential.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A <I>true name</I> is an identifier that links many different kinds
of information about an person, such as a full birth name or social security
number. As in magick, knowing a true name can confer tremendous power to
one's enemies. It also can have major economic value among those who cooperate
peacefully, as in the use of direct marketing to target product information
to those persons most likely to be interested in those particular products.
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A <I>persona</I> is any perstient pattern of behavior, along with consistently
grouped information such as key(s), name(s), network address(es), writing
style, and services provided. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A <I>reputable name</I> is a nym or true name that has a good reputation,
usually because it carries many positive credentials, has a good credit
rating, or is otherwise highly regarded. Companies strive to carry reputable
brand names, while professionals such as doctors and lawyers strive to
have many good personal recommendations of their name. Reputable names
can be difficult to transfer between parties, because reputation assumes
persistence of behavior, but such transfer can sometimes occur (for example,
the sale of brand names between companies). </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Constructing Smart Contracts </FONT></H3>

<P>Blind signatures can be used to construct <I>digital bearer instruments</I>,
objects identified by a unique key, and issued, cleared, and redeemed by
a clearing agent. When an object is transferred, the trasferee can request
the clearing agent to verify that the key has never before been cleared,
and issue a new key. The clearing agent prevents multiple clearing of particular
objects, but can be prevented from linking particular objects one or both
of the clearing nyms who transferred that object. These instruments come
in an &quot;online&quot; variety, cleared during every transfer, and thus
both verifiable and observable, and an &quot;offline&quot; variety, which
can be transfered without being cleared, but is only verifiable when finally
cleared, by revealing any the clearing nym of any intermediate holder who
transfered the object multiple times (a breach of contract). Privacy from
the clearing agent can take the form of transferee-unlinkability, transferer-unlinkability,
or &quot;double blinded&quot; where both transferer and transferee are
unlinkable by the clearing agent. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P><A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/ecash/about.html">Digital cash </A>is
the premier example of a digital bearer instrument, in which the clearing
agent is a bank. Bearer instrument protocols enable online payment while
honoring the characteristics desired of bearer notes, especially unforgeability
(via the clearing mechanism) and transfer confidentiality (via blinding).
</P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>To implement a full transaction of payment for services, we need more
than just the digital cash protocol; we need a protocol that guarantees
that service will be rendered if payment is made, and vice versa. Current
commercial systems use a wide variety of techniques to accomplish this,
such as certified mail, face to face exchange, reliance on credit history
and collection agencies to extend credit, etc. Smart contracts have the
potential to greatly reduce the fraud and enforcement costs of many commercial
transactions. </P>

<P>A <I>credential</I> is a claim made by one party about another. A <I>positive
credential</I> is one the second party would prefer to reveal, such as
a degree from a prestigious school, while that party would prefer not to
reveal a <I>negative credential</I> such as a bad credit rating. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A <A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/publish/bigbro.html">Chaumian credential</A>
is a cryptographic protocol for proving one possesses claims made about
onself by other nyms, without revealing linkages between those nyms. It's
based around the <I>is-a-person credential</I> the true name credential,
used to prove the linkage of otherwise unlinkable nyms, and to prevent
the transfer of nyms between parties. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Another form of credential is <I>bearer credential</I>, a digital bearer
instrument where the object is a credential. Here the second party in the

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Smart Property </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>We can extend the concept of smart contracts to property. Smart property
might be created by embedding smart contracts in physical objects. These
embedded protocols would automatically give control of the keys for operating
the property to the party who rightfully owns that property, based on the
terms of the contract. For example, a car might be rendered inoperable
unless the proper challenge-response protocol is completed with its rightful
owner, preventing theft. If a loan was taken out to buy that car, and the
owner failed to make payments, the smart contract could automatically invoke
a lien, which returns control of the car keys to the bank. This &quot;smart
lien&quot; might be much cheaper and more effective than a repo man. Also
needed is a protocol to provably remove the lien when the loan has been
paid off, as well as hardship and operational exceptions. For example,
it would be rude to revoke operation of the car while it's doing 75 down
the freeway. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Smart property is software or physical devices with the desired characteristics
of ownership embedded into them; for example devices that can be rendered
of far less value to parties who lack possesion of a key, as demonstrated
via a zero knowledge interactive proof. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>One method of implementing smart property is thru operation necessary
data (OND): data necessary to the operation of smart property. For example,
a complex, OND can be proprietary firing sequence needed to operate a computerized
engine, a CAM file needed to manufacture a specialized part, etc. To avoid
theft of service, ZKIP is required to open an encrypted channel to the
device. To avoid leaking the OND to Eve, tamper detection combined with
a dead-man switch can be used on the device end of the channel. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>We might also usedand engrained immobilizing or destructive devices
to foil attempts to hot-wire smart property. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>A <I>smart lien</I> is the sharing of a smart property between parties,
usually two parties called the owner and the lienholder. This property
may be in the proximate possesion of the owner or the lienholder, corresponding
to the common-law notions of &quot;artisan's lien&quot; and &quot;innkeeper's
lien&quot; respectively. Smart liens might be used to secure lines of credit,
insurance policies,and many other kinds of contracts that involve smart
property. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>How can debts be collected? No wise bank will lend unless the lendee
can either be coerced into repaying the debt, or the loan is more than
covered by securely liened collateral plus some conservative function of
its reputation for payment in full and on time. For all parties, both credit
and liability are closely related, and limited. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>The liability of a party is limited by that party's liens and by the
ability to deter that party by threatening punishment for violating contracts
(ie, committing crimes as defined by the contract with the jurisdiction).
The potential for other actions an party might take that cause liability,
such as damage to others' persons or property, also need to be limited.
More on that later. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Many parties, especially new entrants, may lack this reputation capital,
and will thus need to be able to share their property with the bank via
secure liens. A lien is, in a practical sense, a method of sharing a piece
of property between the &quot;owner of record&quot; and a &quot;lienholder&quot;,
instead of the property having strictly one owner. Liens are used in many
large credit transactions, such as auto loans, mortgages, farm loans, etc.
They are enforced by the jurisdiction specified in the contract; usually
this enforcement is done by the government and subsidized by the taxpayers
rather than paid for by the contracting parties. (In fact this usually
is the case with contracts and property rights in general, the enforcement
clause is an implicit government subsidy). One way to implement a lien
without governments is via co-signing with your privately chosen arbitrator
(as long as the arbitratror has a good reputation and the contractual right
to take appropriate action against you). Smart liens might greatly expand
the privity and security of such arrangements. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>As is the case today, credit problems will usually be solved by artfully
written, menacing dunning letters and dings to one's credit rating long
before the lien needs to be invoked. However, the lien needs to be enforceable
to make these dunning letters credible over the long run. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>What about extending the concept of contract to cover agreement to a
prearranged set of tort laws? These tort laws would be defined by contracts
between private arbitration and enforcement agencies, while customers would
have a choice of jurisdictions in this system of free-market &quot;governments&quot;.
If these privately practiced law organizations (PPLs for short) bear ultimate
responsibility for the criminal activities of their customers, or need
to insure lack of defection or future payments on the part of customers,
they may in turn ask for liens against their customers, either in with
contractual terms allowing arrest of customers under certain conditions
(eg if they commit acts specified as criminal by the PPL contract) or (more
likely for mobile world-traveling and virtual pseudonymous customers) smart
liens against liquid assets such as bank accounts and investment portfolios.
Smart liens over information, such as digital bearer securities, can be
implemented via secret sharing (two or more keys required to unlock the
encryption). </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Other important areas of liability include consumer liability and property
damage (including pollution). There need to mechanisms so that, for example,
pollution damage to others' persons or property can be assessed, and liens
should exist so that the polluter can be properly charged and the victims
paid. Where pollution is quantifiable, as with SO2 emissions, markets can
be set up to trade emission rights. The PPLs would have liens in place
to monitor their customer's emissions and assess fees where emission rights
have been exceeded. </P>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Alas, there are some dangers where maximum damage could far surpass
any liens. A good rule of thumb here is that if the risk is against a third
party, and it cannot be liened or insured against, then PPLs should not
allow it to be taken. PPLs that allow their customers to take such risks
against non-PPL parties would ruin their credit rating. One example of
such a risk is building a nuclear plant for which no insurance company
is willing to submit liability coverage. If a plant is safe, presumably
one should be able to convince a good insurance company to cover its potential
to damage others' property. </P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Conclusion </FONT></H3>

<a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/Nick%20Szabo%20foo%20Nick%20Szabo%20bar%20Nick%20Szabo"></a>
<P>Digital cash is here today, and many more smart contract mechanisms
are being designed. So far the design criteria important for automating
contract execution have come from disparate fields like economics and cryptography,
with little cross-communication: little awareness of the technology on
the one hand, and little awareness of its best business uses other. The
idea of smart contracts is to recognize that these efforts are striving
after common objectives, which converge on the concept of smart contracts.
